# Causal-Feature-Selection-with-Monte-Carlo
This project integrates causal inference with Monte Carlo analysis to identify features with direct causal impacts on the target variable in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. By focusing on interpretability and robustness, the project ensures meaningful feature selection and evaluates prediction uncertainty to validate model reliability.

## Dataset Details
- **Name**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- **Size**: 569 records with 32 attributes
- **Target Variable**: Diagnosis (Malignant/Benign)
- **Source**: Available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Key Highlights
1. **Causal Insights**:
   - Identifies features with true causal impact on the target variable, ensuring interpretability and relevance.

2. **Monte Carlo Simulations**:
   - Evaluates prediction uncertainty to enhance model robustness and reliability.

## Results
- Identified features with direct causal impacts on the diagnosis target variable.
- Robust predictions validated through Monte Carlo simulations.
- Enhanced model reliability by quantifying prediction uncertainty.
